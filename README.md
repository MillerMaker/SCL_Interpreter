# Summary and Goals
The goal of this project is to develop a complete interpreter program for a subset of the SCL programming language.
This language is designed by Dr. Jose M. Garrido and can be found here: https://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/%7Ejgarrido/sysplm/
This research paper outlines the development of the entire language processor and includes an executor 
that will work in conjunction with a parser and scanner program. This assignment required that the executor
be developed in a language other than the one used to develop the previous assignment, so Python was used. 

# Description of Solution
This interpreter was developed using the grammar outlined in the "Cohenâ€™s_SCL_Grammar.txt" file in the project folder. The parser
The final solution has six unique classes. These classes are described in the CS4308W02_Cohen_Miller_Deliverable3.docx file.
A sample output demonstration is available in the project folder.
